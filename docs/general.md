### **Pass-by-object-reference* - python

> - *As python is different in this context, the functions in python receive the reference of the same object in the memory as referred by the caller.*
>
> - *However, the function does not receive the **variable**(the **bucket**) that the caller is storing the same object in; like in pass-by-value, the function provides its own bucket and creates an entirely new variable for itself.*
