## Python class andd object

**A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.**

- *Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.*

- *Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator.*

**An Object is an instance of a Class.**

An object consists of:

- **State**: *It is represented by the **attributes** of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.*

- **Behavior**: *It is represented by the **methods** of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.*

- **Identity**: *It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.*
